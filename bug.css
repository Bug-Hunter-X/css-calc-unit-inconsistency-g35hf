The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `calc()` function is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  /* Incorrect usage of calc() */
  height: calc(50% - 10px);
  /* Another incorrect usage */
}
```

The problem lies in the improper subtraction of pixels from percentages.  `calc()` requires consistent units. Subtracting pixels directly from a percentage value is not valid, resulting in incorrect calculations and potentially unexpected layout issues.
